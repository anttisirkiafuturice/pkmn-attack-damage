# Pokemon Card Finder by Attack Damage

Hitting the correct numbers with attacks is crucial in Pokemon TCG. This quick-and-dirty app was built fo AKD999 to have a simple UI for finding correct cards.

It's a HTML/CSS/Javascript app so there's no build process, no deployment, just open up index.html and go.

## Please note:

As this is a quick and dirty draft, I'll add features slowly.

Things missing or not working exactly as should:

- Filter by other fields than **Damage**
